# RoomzSpaces Engine

This is the engine for Roomz, which allows you to create 3D worlds.
## Getting started
Clone the repo and run:

```
npm ci
npm run local
```

Then, to create a new webspace, save this to a new HTML file in a new folder:
```
<html>
<head><script src="http://localhost:8080/assets/js/index.js"></script></head>
<body></body>
</html>
```

And open it up in chrome via File->Open. You will then be able to edit the HTML file as a 3D world.
